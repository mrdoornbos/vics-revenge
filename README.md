# FAQ

### Will it be open source?

Probably

### Will I be able to buy it cheaply

Haven't even decided if I want to offer it at all. If I do, it probably wont be cheap. Small batch, very niche hardware is a good way to turn money you have into less money ;-) 

### Will it extend the original funtionality of the VIC Chip

No. I intend for it to be a drop in replacement and nothing more. It will aim to mimic the output of the original chip as much as possible. The closer we get to exactly the same, the more successful I'll consider it. 

### When will it be done?

Let's get it working at all before we even BEGIN talking about a timeline of any kind.
